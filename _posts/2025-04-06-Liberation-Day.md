On Thursday I woke up to this message from my friend.

I checked the NYTimes app, and lo-and-behold, the world was aghast. The news have been filled with headlines about turmoil in markets ever since.

This got me thinking about why markets move so quickly. When news breaks about an adverse economic event, a sell-off is triggered, prices fall, and the valuation of companies in the stock market falls by billions of dollars. But this money is not destroyed, though people like to use the word "value destruction" because it's sexy.
