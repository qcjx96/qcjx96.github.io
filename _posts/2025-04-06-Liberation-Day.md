## (Work in progress)

On Thursday I woke up to a message from my buddy. I checked the NYTimes app, and lo-and-behold, the world was aghast. The news have been filled with headlines about turmoil in markets ever since.

This got me thinking about why markets move so quickly. When bad news breaks, a sell-off is triggered, prices fall, and the valuation of the stock market falls&mdash;all in the blink of an eye.

Following the "Liberation Day" annoucement, the S&P500 dropped xx% in one day, which translates to a $xx billions valuation loss. But this money is not just gone. (Though some looove to use the term "value destruction." It's better for clicks, I guess.) Though global trade will suffer a shock from the tariffs, and there may be production and job losses in result, does the annoucement have any real effects? Though the stock market was spassing out, it is unlikely that global trade had fallen sharply on the exact day of the annoucement. (?)
