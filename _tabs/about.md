Hi. I'm QCX, and I'm an economic humanist. It's a term I made up myself.

I'm a economist, sort of. And I believe that economics is essentially about people.

It is the job of journalists, psychologists, and social workers to understand a person on an individual level. Economics is about understanding people in the aggregate. To me, the most interesting topics in economics&mdash;including finance, labour markets, public policy, and inequality&mdash;are ultimately about people.

Economics is a "social science" because we study people using the most rigorous methods possible. However, underlying every mathematical model and econometric result are moral judgements about how humans behave and what is good and bad for society.

That's why it's interesting, and incredibly messy.
