Why did Donald Trump start an unnecessary trade war with Canada? The consensus seems to be for no good reason.

His formal justifications are nebulous at best, hovering around border security and the US trade deficit with Canada. These reasons, however, are either detached from reality or based on a flawed understanding of how bilateral trade works.

Canada's contribution to US border problem is negligeable. Less than xx% illegal migrants come from Canada, and less than 1% of fentanyl in the US comes from Canada. [addsource] Almost a rounding error.

The trade deficit with Canada is dwarfed by those of other US trade partners like China and Germany. [addsource]

So why did he really start all this trouble? My favourite pet theory is that he did not like being cucked by Justin Trudeau (even though the President has had a [storied history of alleged adulteries](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-melania-stormy-daniels-affairs-marriages-timeline-2018-3)).

It goes back to a G7 summit in 2019, where a photo of Trudeau kissing First Lady Melania Trump, who was holding the oblivious President's hand, went viral. One French (of course) news outlet reporting on this lead with ["look of lust"](https://www.france24.com/en/20190827-papers-indonesia-names-new-capital-borneo-israel-lebanon-melania-trudeau-g7-photo) in the headline.

The first daughter was not spared the Trudeau photo trap either. Following Trudeau's 2017 visit to Washington, one viral tweet wrote, ["Get someone that looks at you the way Ivanka Trump looks at Justin Trudeau,"](https://x.com/Phil_Lewis_/status/831280292379910144?t=EAPxWbPN6pyIdn-oeZOecQ&s=19) accompanying a snapshot of Ivanka Trump gazing at the Prime Minister with a pondering hand on her chin.

Say what you will about Justin, but our boy is handsome. And there is definitely animosity there from the big man in DC.

But however bizarre these or other reasons for the tariffs are, Canada is now in a trade war against the US, its closest historical trade partner.

Mark Carney, the new Prime Minister replacing Trudeau after the latter's resignation, said after his Liberal Party's election victory that ["Canada will win" the trade war.](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36wkg47z1po.amp) Pierre Poilievre, leader of the main Conservatives opposition, also stated that he [favors a retaliatory response](https://youtube.com/shorts/4ZP7V5cxKPs?si=hMU9ef43AnjcC4nY) to US tariffs. Both major contenders to become the Prime Minister in the coming election this year have stated clear intentions to decouple from the United States in trade relations. [SOURCE]

How might this play out for Canadian industries and workers? Let's first take a look at the current state of affairs between Canada and its main trade partners.

## Canada's Trade Partners

To understand how Canada's trade balance might evolve under the tariffs, let's first look back at the good old days of 2024, the most recent year before the Trump regime.

In 2024, imports from the US totaled $360 billion, constituting about half of all $744 billion Canadian imports. Canadian imports from the entire [European Economic Area plus UK and Switzerland](https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea) (EEA+ for short; these are pretty much the Western European countries) totaled $103 billion, less than a third of US imports. After the US, China is the next largest single-country import partner to Canada at $88 billion.

</figure>

About three-quarters of total Canadian exports ($751 billion) went to the US ($569 billion), dwarfing Western Europe's $70 billion. The next largest single-country export partners are China and UK, receiving a little less than $30 billion of Canadian exports in each country.

Looking at trade through time, the share of US import to Canada has dropped by about 17 percentage points (from ~65% to ~48%) over the past 25 years. Imports from China and countries outside of Western Europe have picked up most of the difference.

</figure>

The share of Canadian exports to the US has also dropped about 11 percentage points (from ~88% to ~77%). The good news is that we appear to have been steadily diversifying from trade with the US. The bad news is that even though we are near historic-lows in reliance on US for trade, and we are still quite reliant. But that's what happens when you have the largest consumer economy in the world as your next-door neighbour.

I also plan to update this post with figures breaking down trade by sectors and provinces.

Canada's trade reliance on the US is starkly clear, especially in terms of exports. Trump's tariffs will take a large toll on producers in Canadian export industries, which will translate to recession and job losses. Canada's reliatory tariffs against the US will also raise prices for certain goods, though they are likely our most effective bargaining chip to negotiate an end to Trump's unsolicited trade war (aside from an agreeing to annexation).

Mark Carney's [visit to Europe](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/world/canada/canada-trump-carney-europe.html) after being sworn in as Prime Minister was a nice gesture for taking action to mitigate the damage that will ensue, but Europe cannot absorb anywhere close to US's demand for Canadian goods. Carney is also campaigning with [a plan to remove interprovincial trade barriers](https://markcarney.ca/one-canadian-economy) within Canada. I'm currently looking into the papers he cited for further analysis on the trade war, but so far I'm skeptical that these efforts will offset trade shocks enough so that we will not feel some hurt in the short term.

I'm not going to lie, the prognosis looks quite grim. But exactly how bad could it be? My next post in this series will be a foray into general equilibrium modeling, which could illustrate the effects of the trade war on the economies overall.
