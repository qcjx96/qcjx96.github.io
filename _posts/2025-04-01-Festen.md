I just watched Thomas Vinterberg's *Festen* (1998) and I really want a drink.

But I haven't had a drink for more than three weeks now. This is the longest time I haven't had a drink in about three years, and the only stretch I haven't had a drink for more than three days.

I don't want to say I've been sober three weeks, because then I'd really sound like an alcoholic. That was the word the doctor used on the phone call the other day, when I told him I had been burning myself with cigarettes and would like a referral to a psychiatrist.

So instead I went for a walk. I wanted to talk to someone, and I thought about messaging this woman I had a threesome with after a kinksters' pub-night in Amsterdam.

"Hey, how are you? How's the burnout?" I thought of writing.

"I know this might be weird so please ignore if you're weirded out. But I just saw an insane movie, Festen by Thomas Vinterberg, and now I just want to talk to someone."

But it was only getting to 10 AM on a Wednesday. She probably already had enough to deal with at work, with the burnout and all.

I'm dealing with some burnout of my own. Ever since I'd gotten home (and stopped drinking), I have wanted to work. I have been trying to start a research blog which I could hopefully use for my PhD applications this winter, about a nine months from now, to explain what I have been doing for a year after I quit my job. So far it's not going so well.
