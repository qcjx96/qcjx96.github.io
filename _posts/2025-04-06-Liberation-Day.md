On Thursday I woke up to a message from my buddy. I checked the NYTimes app, and lo-and-behold, the world was aghast. The news have been filled with headlines about turmoil in markets ever since.

This got me thinking about why markets move so quickly. When bad news breaks, a sell-off is triggered, prices fall, and the total valuation of the stock market falls.

Following the "Liberation Day" annoucement, the S&P500 dropped around xx% in one day, which translates to $xx billions lost. But this money is not destroyed, though media likes to use the term "value destruction." Though global trade will suffer from the tariffs, and there may be production and job losses in result, the annoucement itself does not have any real effects. It is unlikely that global trade has fallen substantially on the exact day of the annoucement, though we can see when the monthly trade comes out in a few weeks.
