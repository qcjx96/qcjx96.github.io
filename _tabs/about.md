Hi! I'm QCX.

I'm an economist (sort of) who worked in academic research. I'm also a humanist, which basically means I love mankind, even if it annoys me sometimes. (Here is [Kurt Vonnegut](https://youtu.be/4_RUgnC1lm8?si=BDQEV-db7JAUGbn_&t=2118)&mdash;one of my favourite humanists&mdash;on the subject.)

I believe that economics is about people. It's a social science. Just as journalists, psychologists, and social workers work to understand individuals, social scientists study people in the aggregate, as rigorously as they can.

This blog serves as a receptacle for my thoughts on these matters intermixed with personal writings. All opinions are my own. Some articles contain explicit content (18+).
