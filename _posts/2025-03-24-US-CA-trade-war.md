Why did Donald Trump start an unnecessary trade war with Canada? The consensus seems to be, simply, for no good reason.

His formal justifications are nebulous at best, hovering around border security and the US trade deficit with Canada. These reasons, however, are either detached from reality or based on a flawed understanding of how bilateral trade works.

Canada's part in US border problem is negligeable. Last year, less than [one-tenth of illegal migrant crossings](https://thehub.ca/2024/11/30/although-canadas-u-s-border-has-one-unlawful-crossing-for-every-10-at-the-mexico-u-s-border-our-unlawful-crossings-have-nearly-doubled-in-the-last-two-years/) and [less than 0.1% of fentanyl seized](https://www.canada.ca/en/privy-council/services/canada-fentanyl-czar/key-data.html) by US customs were at the US-Canadian border. Almost a rounding error. US trade deficit with Canada is also less than [one-fifth that of China and the EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_the_United_States).

So why did he really start all this trouble? My favourite pet theory is that he did not like being cucked by Justin Trudeau (even though the President has had a [storied history of alleged adulteries](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-melania-stormy-daniels-affairs-marriages-timeline-2018-3)).

It goes back to a G7 summit in 2019, which spawned a viral photo of Trudeau kissing First Lady Melania Trump while she held the President's hand. One French news outlet reporting on the exchange lead with the headline, ["Look of lust."](https://www.france24.com/en/20190827-papers-indonesia-names-new-capital-borneo-israel-lebanon-melania-trudeau-g7-photo).

The first daughter was not spared the Trudeau photo trap either. Following the PM's 2017 visit to Washington, one viral tweet wrote, ["Get someone that looks at you the way Ivanka Trump looks at Justin Trudeau,"](https://x.com/Phil_Lewis_/status/831280292379910144?t=EAPxWbPN6pyIdn-oeZOecQ&s=19) accompanying a snapshot of Ivanka gazing at Justin with a pondering hand on her chin.

Say what you will about Justin, but our boy is handsome. And there is definitely animosity there from the big man in DC.

But however bizarre these or other reasons for the tariffs are, Canada is now in a trade war against the US, its closest historical trade partner.

Mark Carney, the new Prime Minister replacing Trudeau after the latter's resignation, said after his Liberal Party's election victory that ["Canada will win" the trade war.](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36wkg47z1po.amp) Pierre Poilievre, leader of the main Conservatives opposition, also stated that he [favors a retaliatory response](https://youtube.com/shorts/4ZP7V5cxKPs?si=hMU9ef43AnjcC4nY) to US tariffs. Both major contenders to become the Prime Minister in the coming election this year have stated clear intentions to decouple from the United States in trade relations. [SOURCE]

How might this play out for Canadian industries and workers? Let's first take a look at the current state of affairs between Canada and its main trade partners.

## Canada's Trade Partners

To understand how Canada's trade balance might evolve under the tariffs, let's first look back at the good old days of 2024, the most recent year before the Trump regime.

In 2024, imports from the US totaled $360 billion, constituting about half of all $744 billion Canadian imports. Canadian imports from the entire [European Economic Area plus UK and Switzerland](https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea) (EEA+ for short; these are pretty much the Western European countries) totaled $103 billion, less than a third of US imports. After the US, China is the next largest single-country import partner to Canada at $88 billion.

About three-quarters of total Canadian exports ($751 billion) went to the US ($569 billion), dwarfing Western Europe's $70 billion. The next largest single-country export partners are China and UK, receiving a little less than $30 billion of Canadian exports in each country.

Looking at trade through time, the share of US import to Canada has dropped by about 17 percentage points (from ~65% to ~48%) over the past 25 years. Imports from China and countries outside of Western Europe have picked up most of the difference.

The share of Canadian exports to the US has also dropped about 11 percentage points (from ~88% to ~77%). The good news is that we appear to have been steadily diversifying from trade with the US. The bad news is that even though we are near historic-lows in reliance on US for trade, and we are still quite reliant. But that's what happens when you have the largest consumer economy in the world as your next-door neighbour.

## Canada's Trade Sectors

Here is a by-sector breakdown. I will say more about these later. I also plan to update this post with figures breaking down trade by provinces.

Canada's trade reliance on the US is stark, especially in terms of exports. Trump's tariffs will take a large toll on producers in Canadian export industries, which will likely translate to a contraction in the economy (i.e. recession) and job losses. Canada's counter-tariffs against the US will also raise prices for the targeted goods, though they are likely our most effective bargaining chip to negotiate an end to Trump's unsolicited trade war (short of agreeing to annexation). These are the direct effects of the tariffs, which will propogate to other aspects of the economy as well.

Mark Carney's [visit to Europe](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/world/canada/canada-trump-carney-europe.html) after being sworn in as Prime Minister was a gesture to show his initiative in mitigating the damage that has ensued, but it's clear that Europe cannot absorb anywhere close to US's demand for Canadian goods. Carney is also campaigning with [a plan to remove interprovincial trade barriers](https://markcarney.ca/one-canadian-economy) within Canada. I'm currently looking into the papers cited in the plan, but so far I'm skeptical that significant pains in the short term can be avoided. However, a detox from US trade was probably overdue. These plans to strengthen non-US trade relations and reduce internal trade barriers will pay dividends in the future.

But I will not lie, the current prognosis looks quite grim. Exactly how bad will it be? More to come in this series.
