Hi! I'm QCX.

I'm an economist, sort of, who worked in academic research. I'm also a humanist, which basically means I love mankind. (Here is [Kurt Vonnegut](https://youtu.be/4_RUgnC1lm8?si=BDQEV-db7JAUGbn_&t=2118)&mdash;one of my favourite humanists&mdash;on the subject.)

Therefore, I call myself an economic humanist. It's a term I made up, though some have come up with [similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanistic_economics) [ideas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanomics) before.

I believe that economics is essentially about people. Just as it's the job of journalists, psychologists, and social workers to understand individuals, it's the job of economists, sociologists, and political scientists to study people in the aggregate. To me, the most interesting topics in economics&mdash;including finance, markets, public policy, and inequality&mdash;are ultimately about people.

Economics is a "social science" because we use the most rigorous methods possible&mdash;like mathematics and statistics&mdash;to address questions about society. However, underlying such models and empirical results are embedded assumptions about human behaviour and morality. That's why it's incredibly messy and fascinating.
